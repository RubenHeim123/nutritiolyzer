# nutritiolyzer

Nutritiolyzer is a Flutter app designed to simplify the tracking of substances in food, aiming to aid in identifying intolerances. It features a login/logout mechanism, a homepage that provides an overview of the food consumed and the corresponding symptoms experienced in chronological order. As an example, three menus and three symptoms have been implemented, which can be added and fully configured on a separate page.

The app also includes a search function for pre-existing symptoms and menus, as well as a purely visual listing of the most frequently consumed ingredients. Furthermore, there's a profile view where users can modify their username, email, date of birth, gender, phone number, and password.
